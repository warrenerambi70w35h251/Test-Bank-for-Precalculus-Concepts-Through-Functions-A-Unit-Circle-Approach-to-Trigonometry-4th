### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0134686977
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134686974
  * * Author:  Mike Sullivan
   
  * The Concepts Through Functions Series introduces functions at the start of each text, and maintains a continuous theme by introducing/developing a new function in every chapter.
 
  * Known for their ability to connect with today’s students, acclaimed authors Sullivan and Sullivan focus on the fundamentals – preparing for class, practice with homework, and reviewing key concepts – encouraging students to master basic skills and develop the conceptual understanding needed for this and future courses. Graphing utility coverage is optional, and can be included at the discretion of each instructor based on course needs.
